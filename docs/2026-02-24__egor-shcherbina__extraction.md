# Extraction — meeting with Egor (2026-02-24)

## Source

- Meeting: `gdrive/Inbox/Meetings/2026_02_24__08_01_egor-shcherbina-proxypolis-strategy-and-automation`  
- Type: strategy \+ operations sync

## Strategic focus (agreed)

- Priority segment: staffing/workforce outsourcing agencies.  
- Value framing: business outcomes first (onboarding speed, lower churn, fewer mistakes), not generic “AI”.  
- Commercial wedge: candidate qualification/training simulations at the entry stage.

## Outreach operating direction

- Founder-led outreach as default mode now.  
- Main channels: LinkedIn \+ Email.  
- Need practical tooling decision for lead sourcing/enrichment/outreach stack (open point for Mani alignment).

## System/process direction

- Planfix as single execution layer (tasks, statuses, ownership).  
- AI-assisted ops: transcript → structured notes → task drafts.  
- Reduce ad-hoc Telegram execution, increase system-based execution.

## Landing/qualification direction

- One-pager \+ short qualification quiz (3–4 questions).  
- Desired integration path: landing form/quiz to Planfix pipeline.

## Risks captured

- Weak conversion if communication tone feels too bot-like.  
- Long decision cycles in larger companies.  
- Compliance/data risk around uploaded client data (GDPR-like concerns).  
- Manual overload risk without workflow automation.

## Open questions (still open)

1. Final outreach stack for lead sourcing/enrichment (e.g., Apollo/Clay alternatives).  
2. Best trust format in first-touch communication (bot vs human-style account boundaries).  
3. Exact data payload expected from qualification quiz.

## Decisions from this extraction

- Keep this file as source extraction for meeting-to-knowledge flow.  
- Move execution items to Planfix in a separate step (stage 3).
